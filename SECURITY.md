## Reporting a Bug

The `XploreX` team and community takes all security bugs very seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of `XploreX`. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing us at xplorex20@gmail.com

We are still a new community but we will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Disclosure Policy

If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We would like to ask you to help us better protect our clients and our systems.

Please do the following:

- Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered, for example by downloading more data than necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability or deleting or modifying other people's data,
- Do not reveal the problem to others until it has been resolved,
- Do not use attacks on physical security, social engineering, distributed denial of service, spam or applications of third parties, and
- Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, so we will be able to resolve it as quickly as possible. Usually, the IP address or the URL of the affected system and a description of the vulnerability will be sufficient, but complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation.

What we promise:

- We will handle your report with strict confidentiality, and not pass on your personal details to third parties without your permission,
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the problem,
- In the public information concerning the problem reported, we will give your name as the discoverer of the problem (unless you desire otherwise)

## Bug Bounty

We are a free community and we don't have any bug bounty programmes as of now, We will update it here if there will be any such programmes in future. Thank you for helping `XploreX`.
